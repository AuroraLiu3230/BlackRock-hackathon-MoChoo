# Mo-Choo: Touchless Gesture Recognition Interface

**Winner of BlackRock Technical Challenge HackKings 2022**

Mo-Choo is an innovative touchless gesture recognition application designed to alleviate the challenges faced by healthcare workers, especially post-pandemic. It offers a unique solution to reduce stress, enhance hygiene, and boost efficiency among healthcare professionals.

## Problem
Healthcare workers often suffer from burnout due to increased exposure to contagions, lack of protective equipment, and excessive administrative tasks, affecting their well-being and patient care.

## Solution
Mo-Choo introduces a real-time hand gesture recognition interface, enabling healthcare workers to interact with devices without physical contact. This minimizes infection risk and improves workflow efficiency. Built with Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and TensorFlow, it recognizes nine essential hand gestures serving as intuitive commands.

## Features
- Real-time touchless gesture recognition.
- Enhances hygiene and reduces infection risk.
- Recognizes gestures such as 'okay', 'stop', 'peace', and more.
- Suitable for healthcare, accessibility, drive-throughs, and hygiene-critical industries.
